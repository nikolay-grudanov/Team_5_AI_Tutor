PART 2

Displays

In this section of the book we are going to examine the components that are used to build an application. We will begin with Tkinter widgets in chapter 4 and an explanation of their key features and their relationship to the underlying Tk widgets they are driving. Remember that Tkinter provides an object-oriented approach to GUIs, so that even though the behavior of the widgets is the same as those widgets created within a Tcl/Tk program, the methods used to create and manipulate them are quite different from within a Tkinter program.

Once we have looked at the widgets and examined Pmw (Python MegaWidgets), which provides a valuable library of application-ready widgets, we will discuss laying out the screen using the various geometry managers that are defined in chapter 5.

Chapter 6 explains how to make your application react to external events. This is an important chapter, since it covers a variety of methods for handling user input.

Chapter 7 shows the application of classes and inheritance as they apply to Tkinter. This is important for programmers new to object-oriented programming and it may be useful for those who are used to OOP as it applies to C++ and Java, since there are some notable differences. Then, in chapter 8, I will introduce more advanced techniques to drive a variety of dialogs and other interaction models.

Chapter 9 introduces panels and machines; this may be a new idea to some readers. It shows how to construct innovative user interfaces which resemble (in most cases) the devices that they control or monitor.

Chapter 10 gives information on building interfaces that permit the user to draw objects on a screen. It then explains methods to change their properties. You will also find some example code which illustrates how Tcl/Tk programs from the demonstration programs distributed with the software can be converted to Tkinter quite easily. Chapter 11 explains how to draw graphs using fairly conventional two-dimensional plots along with some alternative three-dimensional graphics.

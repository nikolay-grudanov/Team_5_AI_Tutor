Putting it all together…

Part 3 covers a number of topics. Not all relate directly to Tkinter, or even Python, necessarily. In chapter 14 we begin by looking at building extensions to Python. Extensions can be an effective way of adding new functionality to Python or they may be used to boost performance to correct problems when you’re using native Python.

Chapter 15 looks at debugging techniques for Python and Tkinter applications, and chapter 16 examines GUI design. Both of these areas can be problematic to programmers, particularly those who are new to GUI applications.

Chapter 17 looks at techniques to get optimum performance from applications. This area can have a dramatic impact on whether your users will like or dislike the interface you have designed.

In chapter 18 we examine threads and other asynchronous techniques. This is only an introduction to the subject, but it may provide a starting point for readers who are interested in this topic.

Finally, chapter 19 documents some methods to package and distribute Python and Tkinter applications. While it’s not exhaustive, it should help programmers to deliver a Python application without involving the end user in setting up complex systems.

  <tr>
    <td>insertwidth</td>
    <td>Specifies a value indicating the total width of the insertion cursor. The value may have any of the forms acceptable to Tkinter (Tk_GetPixels). If a border has been specified for the insertion cursor (using the insertBorderWidth option), the border will be drawn inside the width specified by the insertWidth option.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setgrid</td>
    <td>Specifies a boolean value that determines whether this widget controls the resizing grid for its top-level window. This option is typically used in text widgets, where the information in the widget has a natural size (the size of a character) and it makes sense for the window’s dimensions to be integral numbers of these units. These natural window sizes form a grid. If the setGrid option is set to true then the widget will communicate with the window manager so that when the user interactively resizes the top-level window that contains the widget, the dimensions of the window will be displayed to the user in grid units and the window size will be constrained to integral numbers of grid units. See the section “Gridded geometry management” in the wm manual entry for more details.</td>

    <td>For lines that wrap (so that they cover more than one line on the display) this option specifies additional space to be provided between the display lines that represent a single line of text. The value may have any of the standard forms for screen distances. This option may be overriden with spacing2 options in tags.</td>

Figure 9.4
T3 access card

Figure 9.5  Populated chassis

Running FrontPanel2.py will display the screen shown in figure 9.4. The next step is a little scary. Creating the additional graphic elements and placing them on the cards does not require a lot of code. The code will not be presented here, it may be obtained online. If you run FrontPanel_3.py, you will see the screen in figure 9.5.

A few more words of explanation about the code presented earlier: We are attaching a menu operation to the widget. Access to the menu will be from the keyboard, using the *spacebar* or by clicking with the mouse.

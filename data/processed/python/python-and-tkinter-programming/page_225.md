and that the code to poll the devices agent and to receive and process traps will be developed independently from the GUI.

If this were not a hypothetical device, you would have either the equipment itself or some technical specifications for the device to work from. For this example, we can dream up almost anything! Figure 9.1 shows a line drawing for the equipment. The device has two power supplies, each with a power connector and an on/off switch along with an LED showing the status of the power supply (off, on or failed). There are nine empty card slots, which will be populated with a variety of cards, and there are passive decorations such as the air-intake screens and chassis-mounting screws. The card slots will be populated with a switch card, a processor card, an eight-port 10Base-T Ethernet card*, a four-port FDDI card†, a two-channel T3 access card‡ and four high-speed serial cards. I’m not sure what this device is going to do, who will be configuring it, or who will be paying for it, but it should be fun conjuring it up!

* The most widely installed Ethernet local area networks (LANs) use ordinary telephone twisted-pair wire. When used on Ethernet, this carrier medium is known as 10BASE-T. 10BASE-T supports Ethernet's 10 Mbps transmission speed.
† FDDI is a standard for data transmission on fiber optic lines in a local area network that can extend in range up to 200 km (124 miles).
‡ The T-3 line, a variant of the T-carrier system introduced by the Bell System in the USA in the 1960s, provides 44.736 Mbps. It is commonly used by internet service providers (ISPs).

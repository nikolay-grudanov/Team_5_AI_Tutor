can’t teach you how to do this (a particular technique)—you have to steal it.” My approach to learning Tkinter is similar. If someone in the community has solved a problem, we need to steal it from them. Now, I am not suggesting that we infringe copyright and professional practice! I simply mean you should learn from whatever material is available. I hope that you will use the examples in the book as a starting point for your own creations. In a small number of cases I have used code or the ideas of other programmers. If this is the case I have given the original author an appropriate acknowledgment. If you use one of these pieces of code, I’d appreciate it if you would also acknowledge the original author. After all, what we “steal” has more value than what we produce ourselves—it came from the Sensei!

I was impressed by the format of Douglas A. Young’s The X Window System: Programming and Applications with Xt. It is a little old now, but it had a high proportion of complete code examples, some of which made excellent templates upon which new applications could be built. Python and Tkinter Programming has some parallels in its layout. You will find much longer examples than you may be accustomed to in other programming books. I hope that many of the examples will be useful either as templates or as a source of inspiration for programmers who have to solve a particular problem.

One side effect of presenting complete examples as opposed to providing code fragments is that you will learn a great deal about my style of programming. During the extensive reviews for Python and Tkinter Programming some of the reviewers suggested alternate coding patterns for some of the examples. Wherever possible, I incorporated their suggestions, so that the examples now contain the programming styles of several people. I expect that you will make similar improvements when you come to implement your own solutions.

I hope that you find Python and Tkinter Programming useful. If it saves you even a couple of hours when you have an application to write, then it will have been worth the time spent reading the book.

NumPy

NumPy is a nickname for a package of Numerical Extensions to Python. These extensions add two powerful new types to Python: a new sequence type which implements multidimensional arrays efficiently (multiarray) and a new type of function called a universal function (ufunc) which works efficiently on the new arrays and other sequence types. These new objects give Python the number-crunching power of numeric languages like MATLAB and IDL while maintaining all of the advantages which Python has as a general-purpose programming language. It’s also free, just like the rest of Python.

Python and Tkinter Programming
John E. Grayson

Tkinter (pronounced tea-kay-inter), the GUI package bundled with the Python programming language, is a clean, object-oriented interface to the Tcl/Tk graphical toolkit. It enables you to quickly write GUI code that runs with a native look and feel on Unix, Macintosh, and Windows.

Python and Tkinter Programming is a detailed introduction that carefully leads you through the landscape. It makes Tkinter’s capabilities available to any reader who knows the basics of Python. It gives you real-world code that does real work—no toy examples. And it documents Tkinter in a reference section that you will find often helpful and always easy to use.

Everything you need to add graphics to your applications is here, from a gentle introduction, to hard-working examples, to comprehensive, keyboard-side reference material.

What's inside
■ A master’s advice on creating knock-out interfaces
■ Graphs, blobs, rubber-lines, trees, machines, threads, …
■ Controls such as drawn interfaces, photorealistic panels, and many more
■ How to debug in Python and how to tune performance
■ Reference section with all classes, methods, options

John Grayson can recite by heart any scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. He has a Ph.D. in molecular biology and has been putting Python to work since 1993. He has built large-scale Python applications and innovative user-interfaces for state governments, airlines, and telecommunication companies.

about the reader

Python and Tkinter Programming is intended for programmers who already know Python or who are learning Python (perhaps using Manning’s Quick Python as their guide) who wish to add graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to their applications. Because Python and Tkinter Programming presents many fully functional examples with lots of code annotations, experienced programmers without Python expertise will find the book helpful in using Python and Tkinter to solve immediate problems.

The book may also be used by Tcl/Tk script programmers as a guide to converting from Tcl/Tk to Python and Tkinter. However, I do not intend to get into a philosophical discussion about whether that would be a proper thing to do—I’m biased!

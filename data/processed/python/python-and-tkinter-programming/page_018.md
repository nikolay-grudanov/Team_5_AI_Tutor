special thanks

Writing Python and Tkinter Programming has been the collective effort of many people. Each of these persons contributed their time, expertise and effort to help make the book more effective. Many of the words are theirs and not mine—the book is now better.

I want to thank the team of technical reviewers: Fred L. Drake, Robin Friedrich, Alan Gauld, Bob Gibson, Lynn Grande, Doug Hellmann, Garrett G. Hodgson, Paul Kendrew, Andrew M. Kuchling, Cameron Laird, Gregory A. Landrum, Ivan Van Laningham, Burt Leavenworth, Ken McDonald, Frank McGeough, Robert Meegan, William Peloquin, Robert J. Roberts and Guido van Rossum. They provided detailed comments that resulted in significant improvements to the book’s content, focus and accuracy.

Some of the code examples were derived from code written by others. I want to thank these authors for agreeing to allow me to use their code in this book.

Doug Hellman wrote an excellent module for Pmw, GUIAppD.py, which I adapted as AppShell.py and used for many examples within the book. Doug agreed that I could use the code. If you find AppShell.py useful in your applications, please acknowledge the original author of this work.

Konrad Hinsen wrote TkPlotCanvas.py, which was intended to be used with NumPy, which uses extension modules optimized for numerical operations. I adapted it to run without NumPy and also added some additional graphical capabilities. Again, if you find it useful, please acknowledge Konrad Hinsen.

The Tree and Node classes used in chapter 8 are derived from code released by OpenChem for inclusion within their Open Source project. You might want to look at any future releases from this organization, since the tree-widget examples presented in this book are limited in their capability.

Appendix B uses the man pages for Tk as a starting point for documenting Tkinter. The copyright owners, the Regents of the University of California and Sun Microsystems allow derivative works to be made, provided that the original copyright is acknowledged.

I also want to thank Gordon Smith at General Dynamics for having confidence in the use of Python and Tkinter in some of the projects for which he was responsible; observing their use in real-world applications is one of the factors that prompted me to begin the task of writing the

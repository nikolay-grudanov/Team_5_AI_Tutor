10.5 Stretching canvas objects

A common operation for drawing programs is stretching an existing object. This requires us to provide grab handles which the user can click and drag to resize the object. Before we add resize operations to our drawing example, let’s take a look at a slightly simpler example which was also converted from Tk. This little program allows you to experiment with the two attributes that determine the shape of an arrow, width and arrowshape. You might find this a useful tool if you ever want to create arrows with a distinctive shape.

This widget allows you to experiment with different widths and arrowhead shapes for lines in canvases. To change the line width or the shape of the arrowhead, drag any of the three boxes attached to the oversized arrow. The arrows on the right give examples at normal scale. The text at the bottom shows the configuration options as you'd enter them for a canvas line item.

arrowshape=(8,10,3)

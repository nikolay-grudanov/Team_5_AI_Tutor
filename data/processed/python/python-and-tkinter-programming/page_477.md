Bitmap class

Description
A bitmap is an image whose pixels can display either of two colors or be transparent. A bitmap image is defined by four things: a background color, a foreground color, and two bitmaps, called the source and the mask. Each of the bitmaps specifies 0/1 values for a rectangular array of pixels, and the two bitmaps must have the same dimensions. For pixels where the mask is zero, the image displays nothing, producing a transparent effect. For other pixels, the image displays the foreground color if the source data is 1 and the background color if the source data is 0.

Inheritance
Inherits from Image.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data</td>
    <td>Specifies the contents of the source bitmap as a string. The string must adhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the bitmap program). If both the data and file options are specified, the data option takes precedence.</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>file</td>
    <td>filename gives the name of a file whose contents define the source bitmap. The file must adhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the bitmap program).</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>'icon.xbm'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>maskdata</td>
    <td>Specifies the contents of the mask as a string. The string must adhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the bitmap program). If both the maskdata and maskfile options are specified, the mask-data option takes precedence.</td>
    <td>string</td>

  <tr>
    <td>maskfile</td>
    <td>filename gives the name of a file whose contents define the mask. The file must adhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the bitmap program).</td>

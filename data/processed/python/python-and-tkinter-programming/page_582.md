Components

buttonbox

counter
By default, this component is a Pmw.Counter.

dialogchildsite
This is the child site for the dialog, which may be used to specialize the megawidget by creating other widgets within it. By default it is created with the options (borderwidth = 1, relief = 'raised').

hull
This acts as the body for the entire megawidget. Other components are created as children of the hull to further specialize the widget.

separator
If the separatorwidth initialization option is nonzero, the separator component is the line dividing the area between the button box and the child site.

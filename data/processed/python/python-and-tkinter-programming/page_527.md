  <tr>
    <td>activeborderwidth</td>
    <td>Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D border drawn around active elements. The value may have any of the forms acceptable to Tkinter (Tk_GetPixels). This option is typically only available in widgets displaying more than one element at a time (such as menus but not buttons).</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>postcommand</td>
    <td>If this option is specified then it provides a Tkinter command to execute each time the menu is posted. The command is invoked by the widget before posting the menu. Note that in 8.0 on Macintosh and Windows, all commands in a menu system are executed before any are posted. This is due to the limitations in the individual platforms’s menu managers.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>selectcolor</td>
    <td>Specifies a background color to use when the widget (usually a check or radio-button) is selected. If indicatoron is TRUE then the color applies to the indicator. Under Windows, this color is used as the background for the indicator regardless of the select state. If indicatoron is FALSE, this color is used as the background for the entire widget, in place of background or activeBackground, whenever the widget is selected. If specified as an empty string then no special color is used for displaying when the widget is selected.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>tearoff</td>
    <td>This option must have a proper boolean value, which specifies whether or not the menu should include a tear-off entry at the top. If so, it will exist as entry 0 of the menu and the other entries will number starting at 1. The default menu bindings arrange for the menu to be torn off when the tear-off entry is invoked.</td>

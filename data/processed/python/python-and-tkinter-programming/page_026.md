PART 1

Basic concepts

In part 1, I’ll introduce Python, Tkinter and application programming. Since I assume you’re already somewhat familiar with Python, chapter 1 is intended to illustrate the most important features of the language that will be used throughout the book. Additionally, I’ll discuss features of Python’s support for object-oriented programming so that those of you familiar with C++ or Java can understand how your experience may be applied to Python.

Chapter 2 quickly introduces Tkinter and explains how it relates to Tcl/Tk. You will find details of mapping Tk to Tkinter, along with a brief introduction to the widgets and their appearance.

Chapter 3 illustrates application development with Tkinter using two calculator examples. The first is a simple no-frills calculator that demonstrates basic principles. The second is a partially finished application that shows you how powerful applications may be developed using Python’s and Tkinter’s capabilities.

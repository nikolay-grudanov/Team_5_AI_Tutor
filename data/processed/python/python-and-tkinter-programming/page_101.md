4 We then create the gauge’s indicator, which is going to be drawn on a canvas contained in a frame. The createcomponent method has five standard arguments (name, aliases, group, class and arguments to the constructor) followed by any number of keyword arguments.

5 Then, we construct the scale component in a similar manner.

6 Having completed the constructor, we first call initialiseoptions to check that all of the keyword arguments we supplied have been used. It then calls any option callbacks that have been defined.

7 Once the megawidget’s class has been defined we call the Pmw.forwardmethods method to direct any method calls from other widgets to the scale component.

Figure 4.53 illustrates a possible application of the gauge megawidget as a color mixer. The widget may be reconfigured to show or hide the current value of each slider. It is an easy task to add more options to the widget.

15.5 pdb

If you like to type, this is the debug tool for you! pdb is a basic debugger that will allow you to set breakpoints, get data values and examine the stack, to name but a few of its facilities. Its drawback is that you have to input a lot of data to get to a particular point of interest and when the time comes to do it again, you have to enter the information again!

This tool isn’t for everyone, but if your debug style fits pdb, then it will probably work for you.

15.6 IDLE

IDLE is an emerging IDE for Python. It has some limitations which will reduce as time goes by and its usage increases. You can already see demands for various types of functionality on the Python news group. This will continue to grow as more users find out what is needed in the tool. Make sure that you obtain the latest code rather than using the code packaged in Python 1.5.2—many changes and bug fixes have been made recently.

I have included a screenshot of an IDLE session to give you an idea of what is provided. Try the tool and decide if it will meet your expectations.

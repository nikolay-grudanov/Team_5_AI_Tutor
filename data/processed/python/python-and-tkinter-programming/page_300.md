10.8 Summary

This is another important chapter for those readers who want to manipulate objects on a screen. Whether building a drawing program or a drafting system of a UML editor, the principles are similar and you will find many of the techniques are readily transferable.

One thing is very important when designing interfaces such as these: think carefully about the range of pointing devices that may be used with your program. While it is quite easy to drag an object to resize it when you are using a mouse, it may not be as easy if the user has a trackball or is using one of the embedded keyboard mouse buttons.

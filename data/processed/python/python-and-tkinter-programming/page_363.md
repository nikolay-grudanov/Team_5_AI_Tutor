CHAPTER 16

Designing effective graphics applications

16.1 The elements of good interface design 339
16.2 Human factors 342
16.3 Alternative graphical user interfaces 346
16.4 Summary 347

A graphical user interface has become an expected part of most applications which have direct communication with users. This chapter describes the essentials of good GUI design—but keep in mind that this area is highly subjective, of course. Some considerations of font and color schemes will be covered, along with size, ergonomic and other human factors. Finally, alternatives for GUI design will be suggested, introducing photorealism, virtual reality and other emerging techniques.

Established standards for interface design are noted in the bibliography. Many companies have internal design standards which may be in conflict with established standards; the life of a GUI programmer is not always easy and aesthetics may succumb to standards in some cases.

If one thing should be selected as the major determinant of good GUI design, it is probably simplicity. An elegant interface will display the minimum information necessary to guide the user into inputting data and observing output. As we shall see, there may be cases where a little added complexity enhances an interface, but in general, keep it simple.

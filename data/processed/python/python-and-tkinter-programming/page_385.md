17.6 Summary

Remember the first rule of working on application performance: do nothing unless you, or your users, detect a problem. You can quickly expend a great deal of effort to get relatively insignificant improvements when the same time may be better spent on working on interface ergonomics. Your users will frequently find attention to details in the interface more rewarding. However, if you do find a performance problem, I hope that you find these suggestions helpful.

16.2 Human factors

Extensive documents on Human Factor Engineering describe GUI design in scientific terms (see the Reference section). In particular, font choice may be based on calculating the arc subtended by a character from a point 20 inches from the character (the viewing position). While I have worked on projects where it was necessary to actually measure these angles to confirm compliance with specifications, it is not usually necessary to be so precise.

When designing an application that includes a GUI, you should consider the following human factors:

1 Ensure that the application meets the end user’s expectations. If a paper system is currently being used, the GUI application should mimic at least some of that operation, for example.
2 Keep the interface simple and only request necessary data from the user; accordingly, only display pertinent data.
3 Select fonts that make the interface work effectively. Use as few different fonts as possible within a single screen.
4 Lay out the information in a logical sequence, grouping areas where appropriate, so that the user is led through the information in a smooth fashion, not jumping between key areas.
5 Use color sparingly and to achieve a specific purpose. For example, use color to highlight fields that must be entered by the user as opposed to optional fields.
6 Provide multiple navigation methods in the GUI. It is not always appropriate to require navigation to be mouse-based; tabbing from field to field within a form may be more natural to users than clicking on each field to enter data. Provide both so the user may choose.
7 Ensure consistency in your application. Function keys and control-key combinations should result in similar actions throughout a single application and between applications in a suite.

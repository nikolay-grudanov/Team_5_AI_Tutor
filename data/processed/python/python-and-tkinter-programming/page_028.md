CHAPTER 1

Python

1.1 Introduction to Python programming and a feature review 3
1.2 Key data types: lists, tuples and dictionaries 5
1.3 Classes 9

This chapter defines the key features of Python that make the language ideal for rapid prototyping of systems and for fully-functional applications. Python and Tkinter Programming is not intended to be a learning resource for beginning Python programmers; several other publications are better-suited to this task: Quick Python, Learning Python, Programming Python, Internet Programming in Python and The Python Pocket Reference are all excellent texts. Further information is provided in the “References” section at the end of this book. In this chapter, the key features of Python will be highlighted in concise examples of code to illustrate some of the building blocks that will be used in examples throughout the book.

1.1 Introduction to Python programming and a feature review

As stated earlier, this book is not intended to be used to learn Python basics directly. Programmers experienced in other languages will be able to analyze the examples and discover the key points to programming in Python. However, if you are relatively new to programming generally, then learning Python this way will be a tough, upward struggle.

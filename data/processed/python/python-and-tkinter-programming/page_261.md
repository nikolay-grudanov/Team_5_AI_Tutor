9.7 Summary

The material in this chapter may seem to be very inappropriate for uses other than mechanical devices. Yet there is no reason that information about a system which has no real “front panel” cannot be given an abstract interface. If combinations of the techniques presented in this chapter are used, quite complex devices can be displayed to present status indicators and input devices for users. I hope that you have fun with these examples—there is something very satisfying about generating representations of devices.

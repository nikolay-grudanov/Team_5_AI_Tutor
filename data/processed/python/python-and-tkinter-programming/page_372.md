Here are some suggestions to help you choose an appropriate interface for an application:

1 If a manual system already exists for the application you are about to implement, and it uses paper forms, try to use elements of the system in the GUI. An order entry system would be a good example.

2 If the end user is familiar with a certain display and the application presents some aspects of that display, use familiar shapes, colors and navigation methods. The front-panel of a device controlled with SNMP is a good example.

3 If the application supports a device with a numeric keypad, and users are familiar with it or are trained to use the keypad, provide a graphical representation of the keypad in your interface. Maybe there will be a touch-screen in the future.

4 If the end user is used to interacting with a control panel, without a keyboard, consider how the user can navigate using methods which are natural to them; consider using touch-screen input, for example.

16.4 Summary

Some of the information in this chapter is somewhat subjective. Some fairly-well accepted rules are applied to human factor engineering which you should always consider when designing an application. Using tiny or huge fonts, for example, will immediately invoke a judgement by your user—you want your user to approve of your design. However, that does not mean that you must follow guidelines rigidly; some of the best user interfaces break some of the rules.

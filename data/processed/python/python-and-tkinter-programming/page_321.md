Code comments

1 Despite the complex diagram, the code is quite simple. Much of the code is responsible for drawing the frame and text labels.

2 You may have seen the transform method used in “Adding a hex nut to our class library” on page 131. Its purpose is to calculate a lighter or darker color intensity when given a color.
    def transform(self, base, factor):
3 The transformed color is used to highlight values which exceed a high threshold and to deaccentuate those below a lower threshold.

4 For this example, we generate ten rows of random data.

Because the data was generated randomly, the effect is quite busy. If data is supplied from topological sources, the plot may be used to provide a surface view. Figure 11.8 illustrates the kind of three-dimensional plot that can be produced with such data.

11.4 Strip charts

In this final section we are going to look briefly at using strip charts to display data coming from a source of continuously changing data. Such displays will typically build a plot incrementally as

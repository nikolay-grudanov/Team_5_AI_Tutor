6.9 Summary

The material contained in this chapter is important to a GUI programmer. Almost all GUIs are event-driven and appropriate responses to what can be a deluge of events can be important for performance-sensitive applications.

The second half of the chapter introduced data input validation. This is also an important topic, since failure to identify values that are inappropriate can be infuriating to a user, especially if the user has to retype information into a data-entry screen.

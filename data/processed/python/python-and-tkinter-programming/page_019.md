book. I was able to test some of the draft chapters by giving them to his staff and intern students to solve some of their programming tasks.

Next, I want to thank everyone at Manning Publications who turned my ideas into a book. I had many long conversations with the publisher, Marjan Bace, who led me through the somewhat complex task of writing a book that is going to be useful to its readers. Ted Kennedy coordinated the review process which produced much constructive criticism. Mary Piergies took care of the production of the book with Kristen Black, the copyeditor, and Dottie Marsico, the typesetter, who took my crude attempts to use FrameMaker and gave the book the professional edge it needed. Doug Hellman did a fine technical edit and corrected many code problems found in the final typeset copy.

Finally, I’d like to thank my wife, Allison, and my children, Nina, Chris, Jeff and Alana, for understanding that it wasn’t so much losing a spouse and father but gaining an author.

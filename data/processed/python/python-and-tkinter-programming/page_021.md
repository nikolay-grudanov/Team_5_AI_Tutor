about the author

John Grayson is a consultant specializing in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). He has been supporting application design at a large U.S. communications company for several years, designing innovative interfaces and introducing Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to traditional development methods. Elsewhere, he has delivered real-world applications written in Python and Tkinter for commercial use.

He holds a Bachelor's degree in Applied Biology and a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology—but that has never been an impediment (especially because 90 percent of his thesis covered computer modeling of enzyme behavior).

Before specializing in user interfaces, he was an operating-system specialist and was later instrumental in developing support methodologies for UNIX at Stratus Computer, Inc., he built an F77 compiler and UNIX porting tools at Pacer Software, Inc. and he was an operating-system specialist at Prime Computer, Inc. both in the United States and Great Britain.

2.5 Tkinter widget appearance

To conclude this initial introduction to Tkinter, let’s take a quick look at the appearance of the widgets available to a programmer. In this example, we are just looking at the basic configuration of the widgets and only one canvas drawing option is shown. I’ve changed the border on the frames to add some variety, but you are seeing the widgets with their default appearance. The widgets are shown in figure 2.5. The code is not presented here, but it is available online.

Часть II, "Типы и операции"

Упражнения приведены в главе 9.

1. Основы. Ниже показаны результаты, которые вы должны получить, наряду с комментариями о том, что они означают. Опять-таки обратите внимание, что в некоторых из них используется ; для размещения в одной строке более одного оператора (; является разделителем операторов), а запятые строят кортежи, отображаемые в круглых скобках. Также помните о том, что результат деления / отличается в Python 2.X и Python 3.X (см. главу 5) и помещение вызовов словарных методов внутрь list требуется для отображения результатов в Python 3.X, но не в Python 2.X (см. главу 8):

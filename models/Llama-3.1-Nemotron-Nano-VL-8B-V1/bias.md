Participation considerations from adversely impacted groups [protected classes](https://www.senate.ca.gov/content/protected-classes) in model design and testing:  | We actively considered participation from adversely impacted groups and protected classes during model design and testing by engaging diverse stakeholders, reviewing data for representation, and evaluating outputs for bias. Feedback channels were provided throughout development.
Measures taken to mitigate against unwanted bias:                                                   | We took several steps to reduce unwanted bias, including:<br>- **Evaluating** the model’s answers with regard to fairness for different groups<br>- Using tools to **identify** and measure unfairness.
